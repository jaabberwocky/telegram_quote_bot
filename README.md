# Telegram Bot to generate quotes

Fun project for me to better understand how the Telegram bot API works. Scrapes the `BrainyQuote.com` site and grabs a random quote and returns it to the user.

## How to install
1. Get a bot token by talking to @BotFather
2. Register your token in the `main.py` file
3. Start your bot by `python main.py`
4. Talk to your bot!
